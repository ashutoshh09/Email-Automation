# Email-Automation

**Overview**:
Email automation is a process of sending emails automatically based on certain triggers or conditions. In this case, we will use Google AppScript and HTML to create a script that will send automated emails periodically based on events or actions that occur in your GitHub repository.

**Prerequisites**:
- A Google account
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML

**Setup**:

1. **Create a Google Script Project**:
   - Go to the Google Script Editor (https://script.google.com/).
   - Click on the "+" button to create a new project.
   - Name your project, for example, "Email Automation."

2. **Authorize Script**:
   - In your Google Script project, go to "Resources" > "Libraries."
   - Click on "Add a library" and search for "OAuth2."
   - Select "OAuth2 for Apps Script" and click "Add."
   - Click on "Authorize" and follow the instructions to authorize your script.

3. **Set Up Trigger**:
   - In your script, go to "Edit" > "Current project's triggers."
   - Click on "Add Trigger" and select "Time-driven."
   - Set the desired frequency for your email triggers (e.g., daily).

**Coding**:
1. **HTML Template**:
   - Create a new HTML file in your script project.
   - Design the HTML template for your email, including placeholders for dynamic data.

2. **Script Logic**:
   - In your script file, write JavaScript code to retrieve data from GitHub and populate the placeholders in the HTML template.
   - Implement the function that will send the email using the Gmail service.

3. **Send Email**:
   - Use the Gmail service to send emails with the generated HTML template.

**Deployment**:
1. **Publish Script**:
   - In your script project, go to "Publish" > "Deploy as web app."
   - Select "Execute as me" and click on "Deploy."
   - Copy the web app URL.

**Testing**:
1. **Trigger Event**:
   - Trigger the event that will send the email (e.g., commit to the repository).

2. **Check Email**:
   - Check your inbox for the automated email.

**Benefits**:
- Automates the process of sending emails based on GitHub events.
- Allows you to stay informed about repository activity without manual monitoring.
- Customizable HTML templates provide flexibility in email content.

Note: Remember to adjust the script and HTML template according to your specific requirements and branding.
